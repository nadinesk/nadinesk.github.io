                    Watched 75% at the gym while running (avg 9:25/mi for 2 miles); listened to the rest while trying to fall asleep at 6 am the next day.

                    Before I went to bed. I am so confused about Adriana's music career, just the fact that she has one, I guess. Alexia I think I will always have a soft spot for because of her love for Frankie, I think.

                    While working. This show is getting boring. Gizelle and Ashley are the winners. Everyone else basically loses.

                    I watched this while running on the treadmill, an average 9:20 min/mi for two miles, and then spotty and slow for the third mile. The puppet-master Lisa returns. This episode all felt so scripted. I almost couldn't, just like I almost can never with this show. And yet, I watch. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>3/2/24: Vanderpump Rules, S11 E6 </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I watched this while running on the treadmill, a 10:00 min/mile for two miles, and then a walk for the third mile. I guess I'm getting more into this show, as they try to redeem Tom. I'm enthralled watching because, due to Tom himself, the show cannot succeed at this attempt at redemption for him.  
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>3/3/24: Real Housewives of Miami, S6 E19 </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I watched about 75% of this while running on the treadmill, a 9:52 minute mile for the first mile, 
                        then a 10:14 minute mile the second mile. Then I walked. I was trying a things where I run every day. 
                        We will see how that goes. I think it's just making me slower and my back hurt. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I don't understand how these women can do such horrible things to each other (like Adriana with Alexia; or Larsa
                        with Guerdy) and even sometimes are able to get along with each other and speak to each other. The plastic surgery, 
                        or whatever work most of these women had done between the show and the reunion, was surprisingly good. Lisa looks
                        like maybe she took out some fillers in her cheeks, and possibly Alexia did also?! Larsa looked better than I have
                        possibly ever seen her, but I think it was makeup. The stand-out moment for me was when Kiki said something to Larsa
                        when Larsa was complaining about Kiki talking about her behind her back: All I did was say you're 50! And she's right.
                        That is probably the thing she said that insulted Larsa the most. I can't say I don't get it. I hope I don't fight
                        that hard against aging. Not being on a tv show probably will help with that. Looking forward to watching the remaining part of the reunion.

                    <p>I watched the third part of the reunion while folding laundry early morning. I got absorbed into the episode but it's been a few days
                        since I watched it! 
                    </p>
                    <p>The second and third parts of this reunion got much deeper than the first part. Kiki explained more about her past and her background. 
                        How can one not be on her side? It was basically tragic when they showed the scene where Lisa says somethign like, "What do you want me to do?! 
                        I'm not a therapist!" after Kiki tried to explain to Lisa to basically have some sensitivity to those around you, and some empathy, when
                        she sees non-wealthy people and people in different financial situations than she normally does. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nothing made me realize how far removed from out of touch these women are than the discussion about how 
                        Lisa should maybe drive a Toyota instead of one of Lenny's cars. I've only basically owned Corollas! 
                        And I was beyond excited when we got the one that I still drive. I found that whole
                        discussion of the cars to be so funny and yet so crazy. It was funny until Lisa mockingly drove her nanny/maid's
                        car to an event to prove some kind of point - which was no point because it was her employees' car. No matter
                        how much Guerdy, especially, tries to give Lisa some perspective, Lisa cannot get it.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have watched Guerdy all season since she got diagnosed with breast cancer, try to tell these women, begging them, 
                        to get some perspective. Things are good with them overall, despite minor things and they maybe shouldn't fight
                        so much (but would that be best for the viewers? Questionable). I think she gets through to some of them, maybe
                        who are closer to illness, like Nicole and Julia via Martina's illness and treatment. But for the rest of them, 
                        it's like there is a thick wall she cannot bore through no matter how she tells them, no matter how she
                        shows them what she is experiencing and how difficult it is. It's hard to teach people to have perspective. They 
                        would enjoy what they have more if they did, and that is what I think Guerdy wants to tell them. But they are
                        not there to absorb it beyond anything but maybe like 2%. 
                    </p>
                    <p>And how can you blame them? Because they don't need to get it right now. And that's why I think the whole thing 
                        with Larsa's odd response to Guerdy telling her she has breast cancer (What? How? How? How do you know? Are you sure?)
                        is somewhat forgivable. I give her the benefit of the doubt based on this reasoning, but if it's anything else
                        then it's completely awful: I think she is in the mode of creating a reality TV show. She films scenes and she knows
                        she's creating a scene. When Guerdy told her she has cancer, she was stunned because she had a script in her mind
                        that the would talk about Guerdy calling her fake. Guerdy went off script. All Larsa could think about was: Oh no! 
                        Is this scene now going to make me look bad?! Is Guerdy trying to make me look bad?! She automatically then went
                        to the mode of having to defend herself from looking bad in the scene, to the audience. She didn't have time to 
                        think through this new scenario and she completely freaked out. That is how I took her reaction. If it's anything else, 
                        I don't want to think about that.
