                    Watched 75% at the gym while running (avg 9:25/mi for 2 miles); listened to the rest while trying to fall asleep at 6 am the next day.

                    Before I went to bed. I am so confused about Adriana's music career, just the fact that she has one, I guess. Alexia I think I will always have a soft spot for because of her love for Frankie, I think.

                    I watched this while running on the treadmill, an average 9:20 min/mi for two miles, and then spotty and slow for the third mile. The puppet-master Lisa returns. This episode all felt so scripted. I almost couldn't, just like I almost can never with this show. And yet, I watch. 
                </li>

            <li>3/2/24: Vanderpump Rules, S11 E6 </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I watched this while running on the treadmill, a 10:00 min/mile for two miles, and then a walk for the third mile. I guess I'm getting more into this show, as they try to redeem Tom. I'm enthralled watching because, due to Tom himself, the show cannot succeed at this attempt at redemption for him.  
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>3/3/24: Real Housewives of Miami, S6 E19 </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I watched about 75% of this while running on the treadmill, a 9:52 minute mile for the first mile, 
                        then a 10:14 minute mile the second mile. Then I walked. I was trying a things where I run every day. 
                        We will see how that goes. I think it's just making me slower and my back hurt. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I don't understand how these women can do such horrible things to each other (like Adriana with Alexia; or Larsa
                        with Guerdy) and even sometimes are able to get along with each other and speak to each other. The plastic surgery, 
                        or whatever work most of these women had done between the show and the reunion, was surprisingly good. Lisa looks
                        like maybe she took out some fillers in her cheeks, and possibly Alexia did also?! Larsa looked better than I have
                        possibly ever seen her, but I think it was makeup. The stand-out moment for me was when Kiki said something to Larsa
                        when Larsa was complaining about Kiki talking about her behind her back: All I did was say you're 50! And she's right.
                        That is probably the thing she said that insulted Larsa the most. I can't say I don't get it. I hope I don't fight
                        that hard against aging. Not being on a tv show probably will help with that. Looking forward to watching the remaining part of the reunion.

                <li>
                    <p>I watched the third part of the reunion while folding laundry early morning. I got absorbed into the episode but it's been a few days
                        since I watched it! 
                    </p>
                    <p>The second and third parts of this reunion got much deeper than the first part. Kiki explained more about her past and her background. 
                        How can one not be on her side? It was basically tragic when they showed the scene where Lisa says something like, "What do you want me to do?! 
                        I'm not a therapist!" after Kiki tried to explain to Lisa to basically have some sensitivity to those around her, and some empathy, when
                        she sees non-wealthy people and people in different financial situations than she normally sees. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nothing made me realize how far removed and out of touch these women are than the discussion in one of the past episodes, about how 
                        Lisa should maybe drive a Toyota instead of one of Lenny's cars. I've only basically owned Corollas! 
                        And I was beyond excited when we got the one that I still drive. I found that whole
                        discussion of the cars to be so funny and yet so crazy. It was funny until Lisa mockingly drove her nanny/maid's
                        car to an event to prove some kind of point - which was no point because it was her employees' car. No matter
                        how much Guerdy, especially, tries to give Lisa some perspective, Lisa cannot get it.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have watched Guerdy all season since she got diagnosed with breast cancer, try to tell these women, begging them, 
                        to get some perspective. Things are good with them overall, despite minor things and they maybe shouldn't fight
                        so much (but would that be best for the viewers? Questionable). I think she gets through to some of them, maybe
                        who are closer to illness, like Nicole via her profession, and Julia via Martina's illness and treatment. But for the rest of them, 
                        it's like there is a thick wall she cannot bore through no matter how she tells them, no matter how she
                        shows them what she is experiencing and how difficult it is. It's hard to teach people to have perspective. They 
                        would enjoy what they have more if they did, and that is what I think Guerdy wants to tell them. But they are
                        not there to absorb it beyond anything but maybe like 2% of what she says. 
                    </p>
                    <p>And how can you blame them? Because they don't need to get it right now. And that's why I think the whole thing 
                        with Larsa's odd response to Guerdy telling her she has breast cancer (What? How? How? How do you know? Are you sure?)
                        is somewhat forgivable. I give her the benefit of the doubt based on this reasoning, but if it's anything else
                        then it's completely awful: I think she is in the mode of creating a reality TV show. She films scenes and she knows
                        she's creating a scene. When Guerdy told her she has cancer, she was stunned because she had a script in her mind
                        that the would talk about Guerdy calling her fake. Guerdy went off script. All Larsa could think about was: Oh no! 
                        Is this scene now going to make me look bad?! Is Guerdy trying to make me look bad?! She automatically then went
                        to the mode of having to defend herself from looking bad in the scene, to the audience. She didn't have time to 
                        think through this new scenario and she completely freaked out. That is how I took her reaction; that is what I 
                        choose to believe right now.

            <li>3/19/24: Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Reunions 1-1.5 </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I have watched 1.5-ish episodes of the reunions, part 1 and 2. I watched both on the treadmill, doing a brisk 
                        3-mile run at about 9:30 min/mile. Both runs have been fast for me, to be able to keep the same pace into the
                        third mile. The difference with both of these runs is that they were in the morning, and I did them before
                        I lifted weights/did strength training. I think it makes a difference, but then my strength training lags, but when
                        does it not, let's be honest! 
                    </p>
                    <p>My main take-aways from what I can remember about this reunion, and the things that are burned in my memory 
                        when thinking about these women sitting in very weird proximity to each other on two sofas, is mainly Dorit and
                        the one piece of hair on her forhead that was so meticulously placed there with aluminum. Why do I know this? Because
                        they showed it when she was getting ready. It's the one piece of hair, and the red outfit with the shawl on 
                        her head, with her diminishing figure getting lost in it. It makes her seem very separate from the rest of the 
                        cast, especially as she sits next to Erika with her sequined dress, and sharp shoulderpads. Dorit justified her
                        look to Andy when he commented on it, that it was "fashion." That's it? Please elaborate! 
                    </p>

                    <p>Okay, Dorit's red ensemble was not the only thing I took away from this episode. I think I took away why I have
                        reluctantly been watching this season. I am supposed to like Garcelle because sometimes I think she's the only
                        somewhat grounded one, but I honestly don't even like her. And the rest of the women are even harder to watch. 
                        Garcelle should be 100% sure that Dorit did not actually get robbed before she insinuates that she did not. Words
                        do matter, and now I bet most people who had never considered that it was fabricated, now have that doubt in their mind.
                        That being said, Kyle was definitely insinuating that Sutton has a drinking problem; and maybe it was the right
                        insinuation to make that time. Double standard? Sure. But it's how I feel. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Kyle's monologue about how she has put her whole life on TV was not that impressive, and when she said that all Sutton 
                        talked about was her horse and being on a dating app, I could argue against that. She talked about her younger years, 
                        the men she was close to, the devastation of her divorce, and being fearful of her ex-husband moving away and the uncertainty
                         at the time of whether her son would also be leaving the country. Sutton should have argued against it at that point. Like she 
                        said, Kyle is clever, and she knows what she's doing. Okay, maybe I like Sutton...a little. Maybe her and Anne Marie are 
                        the best ones on the cast right now, and maybe add Crystal, and only because maybe these three have said the least. Less is more!

                    <p>
                        I was able to watch this show while keeping a 9:30 min/mile for just over 3 miles again (a 5K basically). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My take-away from this episode is that I'm glad they are back from Tahoe because the show's beginning attempts to 
                        redeem Tom is now over, and the show continues on the acceptance that most of the cast will accept Tom back, and 
                        we have seen how and why: Lala is jealous of Ariana and cannot see that she refused to accept anyone who talked 
                        to her ex, while she now criticizes Ariana of the same. She excuses herself from this by saying she is moving 
                        on from her trauma and trying to become softer. Her attacks on her former friends and ability to throw Katie under
                        the bus so quickly proves otherwise. Scheana is deeply hurt by Tom but cannot forget the grace he showed her when
                        they began the show, and when he loaned her money recently. She will move on with him in their friendship because 
                        she is a pushover, as the show, and Schena, try to tell us repeatedly; and because Lisa told her to. She knows that
                        their relationship will never be the same, but she will continue their friendship. Also because, like Lala, she 
                        is jealous of Ariana, and especially because Ariana got Dancing with the Stars. Scheana says she can be happy 
                        for Ariana and still wish she got it. Oh please. Just OWN IT! Lala and Scheana need to own their jealousy and 
                        we would all understand and then move on. Okay, onto why James will again be friends with Tom. Despite the fact that
                        Tom majorly betrayed James with his ex-fiance even though they weren't together anymore, it still seems so so icky, 
                        James is accepting Tom back as a friend. Why? Because he, like Scheana, as the show tries to paint both, is 
                        naive. Tom bought him sunglasses. Tom yells at everyone who confronts him about anything he has done. And yet...they 
                        will still be friends with him. What's so crazy, too, is that Ariana and Katie are being iced out. Tom is getting
                        his way with the friend group. It should have been easy for Scheana, Lala, and James, to rally around Ariana, or
                        just even not rally around Tom, after the deception, and Tom showing that he is not to be trusted in any way, and is a 
                        highly manipulative person. They don't see that they are being manipulated again by him, I think because they
                        don't care. They want to see Ariana fall now because they are jealous. 
                    </p>
                    <p>All except Katie, who is the obvious hero of the show now. More on that, later on.</p>

                    <p>
                        I watched this a few days ago, I think most of it walking on the treadmill after running just one measly mile. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This episode was the Katie as a Hero episode. She is the only person who has stood up to and beaten back Tom's manipulations. 
                        Tom came down to "apologize" to Katie as the thing he was supposed to do, for Scheana, I think? He went down to the kitchen
                        when he knew that Katie would be by herself. Then everything he tried to say to apologize to Katie for, she had a retort 
                        for. He was floored, it seemed. He went back upstairs and then started crying...about Rachel? No, I think it was because 
                        Katie did not give him an inch; she didn't succumb to him as he was expecting her to - because the rest of the cast had up to that point. I'm trying
                        to figure out why Scandoval became what it did. I do know that I had no intention of watching this season, and
                        didn't watch the reunion because I was so over it. And now here I am, keeping up with this show. Whyyyy????
