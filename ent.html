                <li>
                    Watched 75% at the gym while running (avg 9:25/mi for 2 miles); listened to the rest while trying to fall asleep at 6 am the next day. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>2/25/24: Real Housewives of Miami, S6, E17</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Before I went to bed. I am so confused about Adriana's music career, just the fact that she has one, I guess. Alexia I think I will always have a soft spot for because of her love for Frankie, I think. 
                </li>

            <li>2/26/24: Real Housewives of Potomac, S8, E14</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    While working. This show is getting boring. Gizelle and Ashley are the winners. Everyone else basically loses.

            <li>3/1/24: Vanderpump Rules, S11 E4 </li>

                    I watched this while running on the treadmill, an average 9:20 min/mi for two miles, and then spotty and slow for the third mile. The puppet-master Lisa returns. This episode all felt so scripted. I almost couldn't, just like I almost can never with this show. And yet, I watch. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>3/2/24: Vanderpump Rules, S11 E6 </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I watched this while running on the treadmill, a 10:00 min/mile for two miles, and then a walk for the third mile. I guess I'm getting more into this show, as they try to redeem Tom. I'm enthralled watching because, due to Tom himself, the show cannot succeed at this attempt at redemption for him.  
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>3/3/24: Real Housewives of Miami, S6 E19 </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I watched about 75% of this while running on the treadmill, a 9:52 minute mile for the first mile, 
                        then a 10:14 minute mile the second mile. Then I walked. I was trying a things where I run every day. 
                        We will see how that goes. I think it's just making me slower and my back hurt. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I don't understand how these women can do such horrible things to each other (like Adriana with Alexia; or Larsa
                        with Guerdy) and even sometimes are able to get along with each other and speak to each other. The plastic surgery, 
                        or whatever work most of these women had done between the show and the reunion, was surprisingly good. Lisa looks
                        like maybe she took out some fillers in her cheeks, and possibly Alexia did also?! Larsa looked better than I have
                        possibly ever seen her, but I think it was makeup. The stand-out moment for me was when Kiki said something to Larsa
                        when Larsa was complaining about Kiki talking about her behind her back: All I did was say you're 50! And she's right.
                        That is probably the thing she said that insulted Larsa the most. I can't say I don't get it. I hope I don't fight
                        that hard against aging. Not being on a tv show probably will help with that. Looking forward to watching the remaining part of the reunion. 
                    </p>
