I created a web app, [here](https://serene-plains-11234.herokuapp.com/) - code [here](https://github.com/nadinesk/tn) - using two of the [NY Times APIs](https://developer.nytimes.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), that displays the New York Times' top and most viewed stories, by section. The app also provides a summary of the stories displayed, using word frequencies from the headlines. 

When I've used React before, I've also used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). I didn't this time, and it made the creation of this site much quicker because I didn't include all the Redux boilerplate. As I grow out this app, I might need to use Redux, but for now it is manageable without it. 

The main lesson I took away from creating this app is the importance of state. Setting state at different points under different conditions and events allowed me to make creating this app more efficient, and with less code. I also had more fun than I've ever had using Javascript in this app, to create the word frequency code.
