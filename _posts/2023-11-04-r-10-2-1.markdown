**1-Create a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ where the points are pink filled in triangles.**

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y= hwy)) +
  geom_point(color="pink")
```

**2-Why did the following code not result in a plot with blue points?**

```
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

The color argument is within aes, but should be outside of it like

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(  color = "blue")
```

**3-What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)**

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, stroke = 2)
```

It provides the width of border of the point, and works with [shapes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html) that have borders.

**4-What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(color = displ < 5)? Note, youâ€™ll also need to specify x and y.**

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = displ < 5))    
```

It provides the color based on if the point is > < 5 then.
