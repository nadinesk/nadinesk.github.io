Exercises [2.4.3](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize)

It's fun to have fun but you have to know how. ~The Cat in the Hat

<ol>
<li>Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different? </li>


```R
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=species))+ geom_bar()
```

The x and y axes are reversed, and the bars are horizontal instead of vertical

<li>How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?</li>

```R
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(color = "red")

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red")

```

The color="red" code changes the outline of the bars to red; the fill="red" code changes the bar itself to red color. The fill="red" is more useful for changing the color of the bars. 

<li>What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do? </li>

 It changes the groupings of data on the x axis, or how the x axis values are divided equally.
