Exercises [2.6.1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize)

**1-Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?**

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")
```

The second plot is saved because it has ggsave immediately after it. 

**2-What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF instead of a PNG? How could you find out what types of image files would work in ggsave()?**

change 
```
ggsave("mpg-lot.png")
```
to
```
ggsave("mpg-lot.pdf")
```
