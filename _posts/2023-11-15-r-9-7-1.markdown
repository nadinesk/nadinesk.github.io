Exercises [9.7.1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers#the-layered-grammar-of-graphics)


### 1-Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using coord_polar().

```
bar_mpg <- ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = class, fill = class)) 

bar_mpg + coord_polar()
```

### 2-Whatâ€™s the difference between coord_quickmap() and coord_map()?

coord_map() projects a portion of the earth, which is approximately spherical, onto a flat 2D plane using any projection defined by the mapproj package. Map projections do not, in general, preserve straight lines, so this requires considerable computation. coord_quickmap() is a quick approximation that does preserve straight lines. It works best for smaller areas closer to the equator.

### 3-What does the following plot tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

```
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```  

coord_fixed() is a fixed scale coordinate system that forces a specified ration between the physical representation of data units on the axes. It is important because it ensures that one unit on the x-axis is teh same lenght as one unit on the y-axis, and makes ratios higher than one longer on the y axis than units on the x-axis and vice versa also. 

geom_abline() adds a reference line that is diagonal (specified by slope and intercept). It is useful for annotating plots.
