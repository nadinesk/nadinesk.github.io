Exercises [4.2.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#exercises-1)

**1-Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?**
`dep_delay` is the difference between `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time`. `dep_time` - `sched_dep_time`

**2-Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.**

```
> flights |>
+     select(dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```
> flights |>
+     select(dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```

**3-What happens if you specify the name of the same variable multiple times in a select() call?**

It only is shown one time

**4-What does the any_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?**

```
variables <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
```

`any_of()` selects any of the columns listed. It's helpful with the `variables` vector because `variables` might be used multiple times, and would be useful instead of writing them out.

From the documentation:
any_of() doesn't check for missing variables. It is especially useful with negative selections, when you would like to make sure a variable is removed.

My example
```
> flights |>
+     select(any_of(variables))
# A tibble: 336,776 × 5
    year month   day dep_delay arr_delay
   <int> <int> <int>     <dbl>     <dbl>
 1  2013     1     1         2        11
 2  2013     1     1         4        20
 3  2013     1     1         2        33
 4  2013     1     1        -1       -18
 5  2013     1     1        -6       -25
 6  2013     1     1        -4        12
 7  2013     1     1        -5        19
 8  2013     1     1        -3       -14
 9  2013     1     1        -3        -8
10  2013     1     1        -2         8
# ℹ 336,766 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

**5-Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with upper and lower case by default? How can you change that default?**

```
flights |> select(contains("TIME"))
```
The results are all columns that contain the word "time" in them. 
The default is to ignore case. You can change that with changing `ignore.case=FALSE`

```
contains(match, ignore.case = FALSE, vars = NULL)
```

**6-Rename air_time to air_time_min to indicate units of measurement and move it to the beginning of the data frame.**

```
> flights |>
+     rename(air_time_min=air_time) %>%
+     relocate(air_time_min)
# A tibble: 336,776 × 19
   air_time_min  year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time
          <dbl> <int> <int> <int>    <int>          <int>
 1          227  2013     1     1      517            515
 2          227  2013     1     1      533            529
 3          160  2013     1     1      542            540
 4          183  2013     1     1      544            545
 5          116  2013     1     1      554            600
 6          150  2013     1     1      554            558
 7          158  2013     1     1      555            600
 8           53  2013     1     1      557            600
 9          140  2013     1     1      557            600
10          138  2013     1     1      558            600
# ℹ 336,766 more rows
# ℹ 13 more variables: dep_delay <dbl>, arr_time <int>,
#   sched_arr_time <int>, arr_delay <dbl>, carrier <chr>,
#   flight <int>, tailnum <chr>, origin <chr>, dest <chr>,
#   distance <dbl>, hour <dbl>, minute <dbl>, time_hour <dttm>
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

**7-Why doesn’t the following work, and what does the error mean?**

```
flights |> 
  select(tailnum) |> 
  arrange(arr_delay)
#> Error in `arrange()`:
#> ℹ In argument: `..1 = arr_delay`.
#> Caused by error:
#> ! object 'arr_delay' not found
```

It doesn't work because `select(tailnum)` changes flights to only include the `tailnum` column, and `arrange` is trying to sort a column that no longer exists in the flights dataframe.
